# PBL

This is a simulated dataset based on a recent study by Saqr and
López-Pernas \[^1\], containing students’ coded utterances in
project-based learning implemented through online forum discussions. In
this dataset, each row represents a team’s collaboration on a problem,
containing the ordered coded utterances in each column. In addition, the
dataset contains the grade for each student. There are 3000 sequences in
total and 10 different types of coded utterances: *agree*, *argue*,
*disagree*, *discuss*, *evaluate*, *facilitate*, *organize*, *question*,
*share*, and *socialize.*
